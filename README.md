Approach used:
what did you do and why and with which tools/libraries
Basically, a brain dump of my work process

I created a new React project
Created components classes for the major part pf my project: Navigation, Main (ie main body) & Footer
For reusability purposes
Created the styling sheets using module.css
mainly for separation of concern
then I wired all the components in the App.js
used the properties on the design sheet

How to run the app
  1. npm install
  2. npm start
